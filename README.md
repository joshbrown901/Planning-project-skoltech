# Project Title: 
Micromouse Maze Simulation and Algorithm Comparison 

# Introduction:
Micromouse contest is a fascinating event important in the area of study within
robotics and artificial intelligence. This project aims to create a comprehensive
micromouse maze environment with an agent (the micromouse), and apply four
planning algorithms covered in our course to compare their performance in solving
maze navigation problems.

# Objectives:
Maze Environment Creation: Build a simulated maze environment with defined
properties, including walls, open spaces, and goal locations. Create an agent
capable of navigating through the maze.
Algorithm Implementation: Implement four planning algorithms (A*, Dijkstra,
Probabilistic Roadmap, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) to solve the maze
navigation problem.

# Performance Comparison: 
Compare the performance of the four algorithms in
terms of efficiency, path quality, and computational resources used.

# Methodology:
# Maze Generation: 
Create mazes with varying complexities, ensuring they
represent real-world navigation challenges.
Algorithm Implementation: Implement A*, Dijkstra, Probabilistic Roadmap
(PRM), and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithms to guide the
micromouse through the maze.
Performance Metrics: Measure and record key metrics such as solution time,
path length used by each algorithm.

# Expected Outcomes:
A fully functional micromouse maze simulation environment.
Comparative data showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of the four planning
algorithms in maze solving scenarios.

# Milestone Goals:
Completion of the micromouse maze environment.
Implementation and testing of the four planning algorithms.
Collection of performance data for algorithm comparison.
